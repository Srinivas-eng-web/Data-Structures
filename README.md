# Data Structures Project

This project contains implementations of basic data structure algorithms.

## My Thoughts

- Learning data structures helps in solving complex problems efficiently.
- Practice writing functions for arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues.
- Code clarity and comments improve maintainability.
